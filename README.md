# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game in Python, designed for a fun and quick playthrough against a computer opponent.

## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a timeless game known and loved by many. This version brings the game to your console, allowing for quick games against an automated opponent. It's a great way to dive into Python programming, exploring concepts like loops, conditionals, and basic AI.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yzzpuri13/tictactoe.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tictactoe
3. Run the game
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py



<h1>How to Play</h1>
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

You are 'X', and the computer is 'O'.

On your turn, input a number from 1-9 to place your 'X' on the board. The numbers correspond to the board positions as follows:


1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9

The first player to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

If the board is filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game is a tie.


## Features

- **Console-Based Interface**: The game is run in the console, making it accessible and easy to play without the need for a graphical interface.
- **Player vs. Computer Gameplay**: Challenge yourself against a computer opponent that makes its moves randomly, ensuring a unique game experience each time.
- **Automatic Win and Tie Detection**: The game automatically detects and announces a win for either player or a tie, ensuring clear game outcomes.
- **Simple and Intuitive**: With a straightforward number-based input system, the game is easy to play for users of all ages.
